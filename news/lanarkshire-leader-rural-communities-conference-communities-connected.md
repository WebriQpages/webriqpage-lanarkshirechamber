We would like to invite you to register for
the Lanarkshire LEADER Annual Conference (supported by South Lanarkshire
Council) on Thursday 1

st September. This event is a development of
the former South Lanarkshire Rural Partnership annual conference and has been
extended to reflect the new LEADER Programme area which now includes part of North
Lanarkshire. You are invited to join us anytime after 5.00pm for soup and
sandwiches and visit our market place, showcasing local groups and
organisations.The conference presentations will start at 6.00pm

The main aim of the conference is to launch
the new Lanarkshire LEADER Programme and advise on the priorities and
objectives against which applications for funding will be assessed. The Programme
has £4million of support available and runs until 2020.

We will again be showcasing some of the
projects we have supported through the previous LEADER programme.  We will also be running 3 interactive
workshops on topics that you have already told us are important.  Whilst details are still being finalised
these will include:

* Explaining the LEADER application
process…what’s new and how to apply.
* Community Shares and Crowdfunding …are these
sustainable funding mechanisms suitable for your organisation?
* How to prepare great funding
applications ….What should you consider and have in place before making an
application.

So save the date and register online using
the attached link.  Further details will
follow in due course.
