Murray Recruitment Ltd was opened in June 2010 by Lauren Murray. The reason Lauren opened this business is because she felt there was a gap in the market to provide quality service. We do this by building long standing relationships with clients and candidates. We like our clients to feel as though we are the recruiter within their company, and we do this by really getting to know them, their business, internal processes and team culture. So when our client needs to recruit we are the only ones that come to mind! This means our clients come back time and time again and pass us referrals. We are 100% committed to getting the job done properly.

 At Murray Recruitment, we deliver a unique service to clients and candidates alike; we do this simply by listening and taking your needs and wants and tailoring our recruitment services so that we can provide a hassle free and successful experience, building a long term relationship in the process.

We spend time face to face with people getting to know them, their business and requirements and to explain exactly how we can help. We understand that finding the right person or role can be very frustrating, difficult and time consuming. With our extensive recruitment knowledge fuelled with passion, it is our priority to help our clients and candidates to be successful. We do this by spending time with you and following our thorough recruitment processes to ensure no stone is left unturned, and you are 100% satisfied at the end of the process.

We understand the trying time candidates are going through applying for positions and then not receiving any response. That is why we have made a promise to reply to every candidate who sends their CV to Murray Recruitment Ltd. Although you may not be suitable for one position, you could be an ideal match for another. We like to pass on advice and guidance for CVâ€™s, Covering Letters and Interviews to help people secure that perfect position. Whether you secure temporary or permanent employment through ourselves, we will keep in touch regularly to ensure everything is going well, and the role meets your expectations.
