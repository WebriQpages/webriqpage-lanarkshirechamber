Following consent from the Scottish Government in July 2014, SSE is preparing plans for the construction of the Clyde extension wind farm project situated between Biggar, Abington and Moffat on the South Lanarkshire and Scottish Borders boundary.

The 54 turbine extension is expected to have a generation
capacity of around 172MW, depending on turbine rating. The site is located to the north-east of the 350MW operational Clyde wind farm creating an infill between the north and central sections of the existing site.

As part of the pre-construction engagement with community
groups, local businesses and local stakeholders, a number of events are planned including an "opportunities for local businesses, suppliers and labour drop-in event" working closely with South Lanarkshire Council, Scottish Borders Council, and Lanarkshire Chamber, and a community open day at Clyde wind farm where local people can visit the site and find out more about plans for construction. Both events will be publicised in due course as plans progress.
Murdo McGhie, SSE Director of Onshore Renewables, said:
"We are pleased to have secured consent for the Clyde extension project, an important development in our portfolio. In our responsible approach to developing this project, we worked closely with local communities and stakeholders to listen and act upon their concerns, we reduced the number of turbines and their location and tip height and we will use existing wind farm infrastructure where possible to minimise any impact.
"This project is expected to bring significant benefits to the region through direct and indirect employment, skills training and more than £20m of long-term support for community projects from the community benefit fund. During the construction phase, we estimate that the project could contribute as much as £121.1m to the Scottish economy and is expected, on average, to support around 500 jobs in Scotland through our supply chain contracts.
"We will continue to keep the local community, local businesses and local stakeholders updated as we work to progress with construction."
