Premium Highland Single Malt Scotch Whisky, anCnoc has announced a brand new regional exclusive will join its Peaty Collection at Whisky Live Paris on 24th September – a full-bodied, long-lasting smoky expression named Stack. 

 With just 6,000 bottles being produced, anCnoc’s limited edition will be released exclusively in Western and Eastern Europe before becoming available in Scandinavia from 21st October. 

 Stack joins sister expressions Peatlands, Tushkar, Rutter, Flaughter, Cutter and Rascan in the award winning range carrying the names of traditional peat cutting tools, referencing the heritage within whisky making and bringing it into the modern day. The term ‘stack’ refers to the last step in the gathering process, where the peat blocks are stored together to dry ahead of being burnt. 

 The liquid, which is pale gold in appearance, introduced by an initial smoky aroma, is gently pierced by accents of lemons and oranges. This citrus sharpness, so typical of anCnoc, slowly gives way to the softer sweetness of honey and vanilla. Earthy peat smoke is overlaid with dark chocolate while green apples complement this with a fruity tang.

 Nestled in the Scottish Highlands, the Knockdhu distillery is on the doorstep of a region rich in peat which is combined with the clear, spring water from nearby Knock Hill to create the distinctive base for all anCnoc’s peaty expressions. Matured for more than 10 years in American oak ex-bourbon barrels, Stack has a full-bodied smoky finish owing to its phenol content of 20 ppm. 

 **anCnoc brand manager Stephanie Allison commented:** _“We’re excited for the release of Stack as it complements the existing collection perfectly. Whilst Peaty connoisseurs will revel in its smooth smoky notes, we would encourage all whisky connoisseurs looking for something different to explore this beautifully crafted expression.”_

 Stack follows the distinctive anCnoc Peaty style, packaged in green glass reflecting the look and feel of Peaty whiskies whilst using contemporary label designs to depict the distillery and its surroundings.

Stack joins the Peaty Collection at a price point of £52 for 70cl and will begin to appear on shelves from 24th September 2016.
