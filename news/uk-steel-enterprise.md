## Business is booming at Strathclyde Business Park

UK Steel Enterprise (UKSE) has announced a raft of new tenants in the last quarter at its Grovewood Business Centre at Strathclyde Business Park in Bellshill, including the arrival of cloud software firm, XEYEX Ltd. 

The 46,500 sq. ft. business centre offers both industrial and commercial units and has been supporting local businesses since 1975. It is now home to 40 companies ranging from small manufacturers and producers to engineers and now software designers. 

UKSE is the Tata Steel subsidiary set up to help businesses and community groups operating in traditional steel producing areas realise their full potential, boost the local economy and help create jobs. 

Anne Clyde, regional manager for Scotland at UKSE, said: 

“This rapid succession of new tenants to our premises demonstrates an encouraging growth in business activity. Our multipurpose business centre supports a range of organisations from those that are progressing from the kitchen table and looking for their first workspace or office, to international organisations that require a base in Central Scotland.

“We are seeing a growth not only in businesses seeking our premises, but also in those who we work with on various investment and equity deals. 

“This is good news not only for the wider economy, but more specifically for the businesses and communities in the regions that we support as they create more employment opportunities.

“Since we established 40 years ago, nearly 700 companies have occupied premises in our Grovewood Business Centre and built up businesses in the region; creating economic growth in Lanarkshire. This is exactly what UKSE is all about.”

New tenant, XEYEX Ltd., which supplies cloud-based patient and practice management systems to retail opticians based all over the UK and Ireland, has moved office as a result of the business expanding. The software developer, which was founded in 2012, was drawn to Grovewood Business Centre because of its prestigious location on Strathclyde Business Park and the high quality of the facilities there; both of which it hopes will help to attract staff.

On moving to the UKSE premises Grant Cardwell, director and co-founder of XEYEX Ltd. said: “We have spent the last four years investing heavily in the research and development of our software, whilst raising awareness of the product in the market. We have subsequently undergone a rapid period of growth and needed a bigger and better space to match our new requirements.

“The move to the UKSE facilities gives us four times the space we had previously. It means that we can accommodate our customers on-site for our events; enabling us to undertake training, demonstrations and even mini-conferences.

“In choosing a new location it was important that we could offer facilities that modern companies boast in order to attract the best staff e.g. showers and changing facilities, luxury toilets and communal kitchens. The Grovewood Business Centre is an impressive building and there are around another 15 companies sharing the 16,000 sq. ft. office complex, so it feels very dynamic.

“The most attractive feature was its great location; with fast access to major motorways. We are now located within an hour’s travel of around 200 independent optical practices, and a further 100 not too much further again. With Glasgow Airport only 20 minutes away in the car, we can visit customers or they can visit us with ease.”

Anne Clyde, added: 

“We are excited to add XEYEX Ltd to our tenant roster; there is a lot of synergy between them and other tenants. We continue to invest in the Centre to ensure that the facilities we offer are some of the best in the region and this is clearly paying dividends as we have been attracting a number of businesses in recent months.

“Many of the businesses that UKSE supports are transitioning from start-up to bigger, challenger brands in their markets. Strathclyde Business Park is a prestigious address and ideally located in the heart of the Central Belt, making it useful for businesses that need to reach the commercial hubs of Glasgow and Edinburgh. 

“Our facilities at the Grovewood Business Centre include both commercial and industrial units. They were designed to be suitable for a wide variety of business types and our convenient, ‘easy-in/easy-out’ policy means that we are as flexible as their business needs us to be. The perfect recipe for a growing firm.”
