 CCG OSM are now on site at a new affordable housing development located on Old Mill Road, Uddingston. Located on the site of the former Uddingston Public Hall, a fully enhanced closed panel system will be utilised for the construction of 12 flats across two three-storey blocks to meet the detailed design of our client and Main Contractor, South Lanarkshire Council.

The apartments are designed to meet Building Standard regulation 7 – Silver level in sustainability. The proposal will include mechanical ventilation with heat recovery systems, triple glazing, photovoltaic electricity generation, and enhanced insulation to minimise household energy costs.

**CCG OSM Managing Director, Steven Earlie, said:** “Uddingston is a well-established town in the area of South Lanarkshire but it is also one that is need of new, affordable housing. CCG OSM has worked on many different projects with South Lanarkshire Council, including recently where we were working with Morgan Sindall on a new extension to Udston Primary School.

“This is an important project for the Council and one which we are proud to deliver an enhanced product that will ensure efficiencies in delivery as well energy savings for the future residents.”

Old Mill Road is due for completion in spring 2017.
