Three is the magic number for UK Steel Enterprise (UKSE), which has awarded more than £8,000 to a trio of community projects across Lanarkshire and Ayrshire.

UKSE, the Tata Steel subsidiary, offers finance to growing businesses and grants to community projects to support economic regeneration in traditional steel producing areas.

Three community groups, Jack’s Garage, Little Art School and Paradventures, have been awarded funding for projects which will benefit the communities of Rigside, Ayr and Lanark.

Jack’s Garage, a social enterprise in Rigside is aiming to provide employment and volunteering opportunities through a vintage themed attraction including a transport museum and 1950s style diner, received £2,500 for an initial feasibility study.

The Little Art School in Ayr also received £2,500 for a new art program for young carers. The project will encourage participants to work as individuals and as part of a larger group, from carefully crafting their own art journals to working on canvas and learning to use various art mediums to express and manage their emotions.

The final recipient was Lanark-based charity Paradventures, which organises and delivers outdoor and residential adventures for disabled young people. Funding of £2,350 was used to pay for a professional promotional video to showcase the charity’s services to people with disabilities and encourage them to venture into the great outdoors.

Additional funding of £1.5 million has been put in place by UKSE to help support Scotland’s areas affected by recent steel industry job losses, on top of the £10 million already earmarked for UK steel communities over the next five years. 

Anne Clyde, regional manager at UK Steel Enterprise, said: “With more money than ever to spend in Scotland we are keen to support community groups as well as companies with their growth plans. 

“These three projects individually impressed us, they are great causes and provides unique opportunities for people who need them most.”

Any community group based in Glasgow, Ayrshire or Lanarkshire can apply for funding for a specific project. Contact UK Steel Enterprise for more information by emailing [scot@ukse.co.uk](mailto:scot@ukse.co.uk).
