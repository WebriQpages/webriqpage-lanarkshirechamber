Levenseat Ltd and Re-Tek UK Limited in South Lanarkshire are among the 32 Scottish companies that have been shortlisted for this year’s Vision in Business for the Environment of Scotland (VIBES) Awards following a record number of entries. 

   A diverse range of companies from across Scotland entered the 17th annual environmental award scheme which recognises and rewards the commitment, actions and achievements of Scottish companies working hard to reduce their impact on the environment.

   East Kilbride based Re-Tek UK Limited has been shortlisted for the Circular Economy Award. The company recovers asset value through repair, refurbishment and re-use of excess or redundant Information Communications Technology (ICT) equipment. 

   Levenseat Ltd, a recycling and waste management company in Lanark, has been shortlisted for the Environmental Product or Service Award. The company is committed to developing new ways to recover the best resources and provide customers with environmental and economic solutions.

   The shortlisted businesses will attend a special ceremony on the 8th November 2016 at the Radisson Blu, where the winners of all eight categories will be announced. 

   Awards will be presented for Management (SME (under 250 employees) and Large (250+ employees)), Environmental Product or Service, Transport and Circular Economy along with two new categories, Green Team and Innovation, a special theme category in celebration of Scotland’s Year of Innovation, Architecture and Design. There will also be a Hydro Nation Challenge Award in collaboration with WaterAid. 

   A Micro Business Award will be presented for the best entry to any category from a company with less than 10 employees.

   Gillian Bruce, chair of the VIBES Awards, said: “It’s been a fantastic start to the 17th annual awards with a record number of entries keeping our judges busy. VIBES is dedicated to recognising companies which have taken significant steps to reducing their environmental impact so it’s extremely rewarding to see such a wide range of businesses sharing their great work with us.   0000�# �
