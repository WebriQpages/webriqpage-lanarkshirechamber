Stewart Meikle, Commercial Director of AmeyCespa, the waste division of infrastructure company Amey and who is based at Amey's Eurocentral office in Motherwell, writes to tell fellow members of the Chamber about a new project the company is proposing for North Lanarkshire.

There is an increasing need for us to do more to save our environment and natural resources and a key way of doing so is by increasing the amount of materials we reduce, recycle and reuse.

AmeyCespa is proposing to build a new waste treatment facility in North Lanarkshire. Greenhills is a state of the art Energy from Waste (EfW) facility designed to handle waste from five Scottish local authorities as part of the Clyde Valley Residual Waste Project.
The Clyde Valley Residual Waste Project is a shared service contract agreed by a consortium of Partner Councils, comprising North Lanarkshire, East Dunbartonshire, North Ayrshire, Renfrewshire and East Renfrewshire Councils, to share waste management services. A contract has gone to tender by these Partner Councils and AmeyCespa is one of three waste management companies involved in the bid process.

The Greenhills facility is our proposed solution. Once built, Greenhills will be capable of handling up to 300,000 tonnes of household waste each year.

Unusable waste materials will then be used to fuel an EfW plant, which in turn will produce electricity for exporting to the grid. Greenhills will help to transform the local area, creating new jobs for local people and turning local waste into energy for the local community. There will also be a visitor and education centre created for the use of the community and schools.
During the construction phase of the project, it is expected that several hundred jobs will be created, with further long term jobs being created once the facility has been built.

Greenhills will allow household waste to be diverted from landfill, save taxpayers' money and prevent landfill from contributing to the production of greenhouse gases, such as methane.

We believe Greenhills will serve as a catalyst for all local businesses by providing either direct opportunities to join our supply chain, or by providing goods and services to the facility and our sub-contractors during the construction and operation stages of the project.

As Chamber members we want to ensure local businesses are aware of this project and we hope to be able to work with many of you in the future.
