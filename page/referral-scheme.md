Our success as a Chamber depends on representing and advocating on behalf of as many businesses in Lanarkshire as possible. We want to recruit more members to strengthen our business network and create more business opportunities for you. Under our referral scheme, existing members can refer companies known to them who are interested in joining the Lanarkshire Chamber.

To say thank-you, we'll give you a free ticket to any ticketed event run by the Chamber, a 50% discount on a full page advertisement in our magazine, INCommerce, and 50% off your next annual membership!

So what are you waiting for? Start referring and start benefitting today!
