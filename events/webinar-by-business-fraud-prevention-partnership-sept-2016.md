Lanarkshire Chambers of Commerce have teamed up with the Business Fraud Prevention Partnership to deliver a webinar to assist members in preventing fraud and cyber-crime. Fraud currently affects 49% of all SMEs, with 94% of such incidents being entirely preventable.

During this webinar, former police officer and qualified solicitor, Eddie Whittingham, will provide members with valuable fraud prevention measures and techniques, specifically tailored to SMEs. In addition, all attendees will benefit from a free fraud and cyber-crime risk assessment, as well as a free innovative phishing email simulation.

The BFPP was founded by Eddie Whittingham, having had experience of working with FTSE companies in their fraud against fraud, as well as his extensive police experience. The BFPP focuses on ensuring SMEs benefit from the same level of protection that is afforded to large corporations, through collaboration and innovative testing.

Known for his down to earth manner and his ability to simplify even the most complicated matters, the webinar is not to be missed for all SME business owners wanting to ensure they're protected.
