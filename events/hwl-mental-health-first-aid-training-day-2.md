Did you know that all employers have legal responsibility under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 to ensure the health safety and welfare at work of their employees which  includes minimising the risk of stress-related illness or injury to employees?

Healthier workforces are more productive, and being recognised as an employer that takes the health and wellbeing of employees seriously reflects positively on the reputation and culture of any organisation.  The following sessions will support workplaces to demonstrate good practice.

### Outline

Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) is a nationally accredited 2-day training course designed to give participants the knowledge and skills to recognise the signs of mental ill-health and support someone to seek the right help.
