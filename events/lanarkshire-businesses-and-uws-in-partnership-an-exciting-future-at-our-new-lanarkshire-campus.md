*** An invitation to tell us how we can help your business

UWS is moving into Hamilton International Technology Park (HITP) with its first students anticipated in September 2017. This will provide a state-of-the-art, modern university campus, just over two miles from the existing site on Almada Street, Hamilton. The campus will include teaching and learning facilities, student accommodation, specialist laboratory space and a Students’ Union.  

 The existing campus contributes £69.3 million to the economy, and supports 771 jobs in South Lanarkshire. The estimated additional economic benefit of the campus over the next 25 years could be as high as £1.9 billion (BiGGAR Economics report 2015).  

 We would like the opportunity to discuss what you need from a university, and we’ll use this information to shape our support to business from the new campus. It’s crucial that we get this right and only you can help us achieve this. Therefore we invite you to join us on August 17th 2016 at the Hilton Strathclyde Hotel to take part in a number of themed interactive workshops where we will listen closely to you. We will then use this input to help shape the activities and capabilities available from the new campus.
