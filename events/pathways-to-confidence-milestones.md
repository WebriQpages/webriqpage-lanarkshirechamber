The Wm Grant Foundation has been the catalyst for an exciting Third Sector project across the Hamilton/Blantyre/Uddingston/Bellshill and Viewpark areas of Lanarkshire.

COVEY BEFRIENDING based in Hamilton has partnered with Bellshill and Mossend YMCA to provide support to vulnerable young people and their families. Already 18 months in they are seeing a significant positive impact for the families.

Rhoda Reid from COVEY as project leader says that this initiative sits very well with their overall vision that young people receive the consistent reliable support they need to help them achieve their potential.

COVEY has recently expanded their opportunities for volunteering and will be happy to link with local businesses and individuals who are interested in making a difference in their community.

If you know of anyone who has two to three hours a week, they can work one to one with a young person or a parent, help in a group setting with isolated young people, have fun in a group for additional needs young people or help with marketing, events or driving!

View the COVEY website and give Rhoda a call if you are interested.
