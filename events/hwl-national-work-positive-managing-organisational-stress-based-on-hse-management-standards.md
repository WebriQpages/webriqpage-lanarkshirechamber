Did you know that all employers have legal responsibility under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 to ensure the health safety and welfare at work of their employees which  includes minimising the risk of stress-related illness or injury to employees?

Healthier workforces are more productive, and being recognised as an employer that takes the health and wellbeing of employees seriously reflects positively on the reputation and culture of any organisation.  The following sessions will support workplaces to demonstrate good practice.

### Outline

This course is aimed at HR, H&S or other representative from organisations wishing to develop a Wellbeing Strategy and/or a proactive approach to psychosocial risk management. 

It provides information on the HSE Management Standards for Work-related Stress and the Work Positive risk management process. It includes practical exercises to develop skills required to conduct a stress risk assessment and action plan in the workplace. 

Delegates leave the session with a draft project plan for implementing the Work Positive process in their workplace as well as lots of other useful resources to take away.
