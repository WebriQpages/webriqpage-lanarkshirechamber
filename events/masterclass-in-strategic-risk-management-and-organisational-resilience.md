Presented by Professor Edward P.

It assumes no prior knowledge of the topic and introduces some of the latest research on managing risk from the human sciences.

It will also be of interest to senior staff in local and central government agencies, business continuity managers, insurance buyers, the security and emergency services, legal and regulators.

  **Topics will include:**

  * Theoretical perspectives on risk including the social construction of risk, risk perception, social amplification of risk and risk communication;
* Legislation and policy issues and strategic risk management;
* Tools and techniques for assessing and managing strategic risk;
* Identification of cultural barriers to effective risk management and the development of resilient organisations;
* Integrated approaches to resilience management that emphasise rigour, insight and intra and inter-organisational working;
* Methodologies in Business Continuity Management.
